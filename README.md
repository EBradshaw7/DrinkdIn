Final Year Thesis Project, Author: Eoghan Bradshaw, Supervisor Luke Raeside 

An Application to benefit tourists in Dublin. The main goal is to recommend a bar for the end-user to suit their taste. The app will direct the user to their chosen bar and then allow customers to check-in and rate a pub built using a firebase back end. My background in the bars and tourism sector helped the design process. The project was well-received as the application and awarded first-class honours.
